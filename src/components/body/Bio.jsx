        The <span className="lg:text-2xl text-lg text-blue-300">Secret Formula Band</span>{" "}
        is a Southern rock group out of Charlotte, North Carolina that has been
        together since February 2022. The group brings a rugged, soulful noise
        to the stage that sounds as good as Miller Lite tastes. Drawing
        inspiration from some of their favorite blues, rock, and country artists
        â€“ BB King, Pink Floyd, Tyler Childers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Grateful Dead
        - the group brings dynamic, improvisational music with a distinctly
        southern flair.
