          Secret Formula Band is a southern rock group out of Charlotte, North
          Carolina, that has been together since February 2022. The group brings
          a rugged, soulful noise to the stage that sounds as good as Miller
          Lite tastes. Drawing inspiration from some of their favorite blues,
          rock, and country artists â€“ BB King, Pink Floyd, Tyler Childers,
          Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Grateful Dead - the group brings dynamic,
          improvisational music with a distinctly southern flair.
